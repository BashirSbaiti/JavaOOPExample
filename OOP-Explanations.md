# Object Oriented Programming Descriptions
### Encapsulation
Containing data within the class that manipulates it and therefore not allowing other classes to access it.
##### Pros
+ Allows variables to be read/write only
+ Allows for more reusability
+ Allows for data to be hidden from the user
##### Cons
+ It's not always best to hide data from users
### Inheritance
When a class acts as an extension of a parent class be using its methods to preform its functionality.
##### Pros
+ Avoids a lot of redundancy
+ Reusability
+ Saves time (comes with reduced redundancy)
##### Cons
+ Programs required to jump around classes to run
+ Creates interdependencies
### Polymorphism
The ability for a functionalty (method) to take many forms
#### Runtime Polymorphism
Method overrides, override resolves in runtime
#### Compile Time Polymorphism
Operator/method overloades, resolves in compile time
##### Pros
+ Overloading can expand the functionality of a program's methods greatly
+ Overriding allows parents to have general implementations while children are more specific 
##### Cons
+ Reduces redability
### Abstraction
Implementation details are hidden in the class
##### Pros
+ Simplifies class
+ Increases reusability
+ Added security from hiding implementation details
##### Cons
+ Creates interdependencies
